# HikingGuide

Hiking Guide is a CLI Gem that allows users to browse hiking trails in the US mid-Atlantic region. Following the command-line prompts, users can see trail details and get links to maps of trails in Maryland, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia.

The information in Hiking Guide comes from a volunteer organization called [Hiking Upward](http://www.hikingupward.com/). If you find the information useful, please consider volunteering as a Trail Contributer, or donating to the organization.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hiking_guide'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hiking_guide

## Usage

Run: ```hiking_guide``` after installing the gem.

Follow the prompts to browse through lists of hiking trails by state, all from the comfort of your command line.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
